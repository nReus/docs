## Synopsis

The school festival at Uchihama Academy is almost here, and with it, tensions at the school are at an all-time high. Not only because of scheduling disputes, but also due to rumors of mysterious incidents that have occurred lately on and off campus. Plus, this will be the last festival held at the old school building before moving to one newly being constructed. Akiyama Sou is a member of the notorious astronomy club, which has been tasked by the student council to both resolve these disputes, and also to calm any fears that have cropped up from those rumors.

One evening after an incident involving the judo club, Sou is recuperating in the infirmary when the building shakes and he hears a loud sound from one of the upper floors. Concerned, he investigates the fifth floor only to discover an unconscious naked girl who upon awakening seems to know him, later introducing herself as Furukawa Yui. The next day, she seeks out the astronomy club, expressing her desire to join.
